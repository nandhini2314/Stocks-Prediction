# Stocks-Prediction
Stocks of any brand can be predicted using ML and Python.
I have used the LSTM model of ML along with several libraries of python such as NumPy,Pandas,tensorFlow, Keras. The webpage has been made using the streamlit application. Here we can see how closely the actual stocks are to the predicted values.
